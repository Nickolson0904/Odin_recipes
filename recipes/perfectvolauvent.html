<H4>This year round classic Belgian dish, a chicken stew, was not my favourite until I started making it myself. The appearance can sometimes be off putting and at school I didn’t like it at all. Look on the menu in Belgium for: “vol-au-vent” ( windblown) or “Koninginnehapje” ( queens bite). It is basically a chicken stew made from a whole boiled chicken, a roux and chicken stock, a little cream and small meatballs and mushrooms, served in a small round hollow puff pastry case accompanied by rice, fries or mash potatoes. </H4>

 <p>As part of a series of Belgian dishes posted every first Wednesday of the month, I vow to demystify these uber Belgian classics for you. Step-by-step I will show you what to do, this will have you successfully recreate those gorgeous rustic Belgian flavours.</p> 
    
<p><strong>VOL-AU-VENT</strong> as most of our Belgian classics also this was an original French recipe . The chicken stew saw daylight under King Louis XV wife Queen Marie Leszczynska at the Royal court in Versailles called “Bouchée à la reine” . She was notorious for instructing the Royal kitchens to come up with new original dishes to distract the king from visiting his mistresses. This was made with chicken, sweetbreads (riz-de-veau) and ham. Us Belgians adopted the dish but omitted a few ingredients and made it their own by adding mushrooms and small meatballs. It is one of those dishes you can find on any Belgian brasserie menu at any time of the year. Rather easy to make is this chicken stew and very popular with kids. </p>
