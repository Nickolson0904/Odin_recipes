<H4>You say bolognese, we say al ragù. 
    Regardless of what you call it, 
    this meat sauce served with ribbons of fresh 
    tagliatelle is a go-to pasta, especially on Sundays. </H4>

 <p>Bolognese ragù is said to have originated in the 
    16th century in the wealthy courts of noble families, 
    according to Lynne Rossetto Kasper, 
    author of The Italian Country Table.</p> 
    
<p>The first evidence of the use of ragù in pasta, 
        and not as a main course, was by <a href="https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/trends/restaurants-and-chefs/pellegrino-artusi-inventor-of-italian-cuisine">Pellegrino Artusi</a>. 
        Although it is difficult to identify an "original" recipe for the meat sauce, 
        the Italian Academy of Cuisine's Bolognese delegation <a href="https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/italian-food/hacks/bolognese-sauce">officially defined the recipe </a> in its most “authentic” form at the Bologna Chamber of Commerce in 1982. Though, as is the case with most recipes, they vary from family to family, so not necessarily adhering to the “rules” 
        doesn't render a preparation any less meaningful or delicious. </p>

<p> Pasta selection is also essential for the success of the dish, 
    only second to the sauce. Any cook (amateur or not) from Bologna 
    and its surroundings will tell you that the pasta meant for 
    Bolognese ragù is undoubtedly <a href="https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/glossary/tagliatelle">tagliatelle</a> better yet, one made 
    from egg as it’s more porous and therefore perfect 
    for soaking up the sauce. And if you have any sauce leftover, 
    don’t be shy… scoop it up with some bread and fare la scarpetta!</p>
