<H4>You say bolognese, we say al ragù. 
    Regardless of what you call it, 
    this meat sauce served with ribbons of fresh 
    tagliatelle is a go-to pasta, especially on Sundays. </H4>

 <p>Bolognese ragù is said to have originated in the 
    16th century in the wealthy courts of noble families, 
    according to Lynne Rossetto Kasper, 
    author of The Italian Country Table.</p> 
    
<p>The first evidence of the use of ragù in pasta, 
        and not as a main course, was by <a href="https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/trends/restaurants-and-chefs/pellegrino-artusi-inventor-of-italian-cuisine">Pellegrino Artusi</a>. 
        Although it is difficult to identify an "original" recipe for the meat sauce, 
        the Italian Academy of Cuisine's Bolognese delegation <a href="https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/italian-food/hacks/bolognese-sauce">officially defined the recipe </a> in its most “authentic” form at the Bologna Chamber of Commerce in 1982. Though, as is the case with most recipes, they vary from family to family, so not necessarily adhering to the “rules” 
        doesn't render a preparation any less meaningful or delicious. </p>

<p> Pasta selection is also essential for the success of the dish, 
    only second to the sauce. Any cook (amateur or not) from Bologna 
    and its surroundings will tell you that the pasta meant for 
    Bolognese ragù is undoubtedly <a href="https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/glossary/tagliatelle">tagliatelle</a> better yet, one made 
    from egg as it’s more porous and therefore perfect 
    for soaking up the sauce. And if you have any sauce leftover, 
    don’t be shy… scoop it up with some bread and fare la scarpetta!</p>

<H1> This is the perfect flemish beer stew</H1>
<img src="https://www.diversivore.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carbonnade-Flamande-banner.jpg">

<p><H4>The classic Belgian/Flemish beer-and-beef stew Carbonnade Flamande (also spelled Carbonade) is sure to become a classic in your household - 
    especially since you can easily adapt it to your kitchen, and to many dietary restrictions.  Once you've finished the initial skillet-based flavour-
    building steps, the stew itself can be finished with an electric pressure cooker (e.g. Instant Pot), slow cooker, or on the stovetop. 
     It's easily made dairy-free, and with a bit of effort, it can be made gluten-free as well.</H4></p>

<p>There are plenty of wonderful perks to becoming a more talented and confident cook.  Better tasting food is, obviously, the biggest plus.  
    Kind of a necessary perquisite, when you really think about it.  But there are a lot of other, subtle bonuses that pop up as you become better in the kitchen. 
     One of my favourites is something I like to call 'mental-taste-testing.'  Alright fine, I've never called it that before now, but that's only because I've never had to put it into words.  
     `What I'm talking about is the ability to read a set of ingredients (plus or minus the instructions) and instantly get an idea of what the dish will taste like. 
      Everyone has this skill at some level of course - nobody starts making a chocolate cake while thinking 'gee, I hope this doesn't end up tasting like chicken pot pie.'  
      But the more you cook, the more refined this skill becomes.  Over time, you start honing in on individual ingredients and their quantities, instantly shifting your perception of what a recipe will (or at least should) taste like.  
      Developing this skill helps you decide on the recipes you want to try, figure out substitutions, and adjust quantities based on your own preferences, all without having even picked up a kitchen knife.</p>

<p><em>Why do I lead in with this, dear reader?</em>  Because the phenomenal Flemish/Belgian beef dish known as carbonnade flamande shouldn't be glossed over
     or dismissed as just another stew.  If you've got a good sense for mental-taste-testing, take a look at the ingredients, and I think you'll see what I mean. 
      Sure, it's got all of the standard beef stew pluses, but a handful of ingredients really set it apart:</p> 
    
<p><H2>Ingredients</H2></p>
<p><ul>
<li> <em>Lots</em> of onions</li>
<li> <strong>Strong dark beer</strong> </li>
<li> Sugar & Vinegar</li>
<li>2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, crushed and chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, packed</li>

</ul></p>

<p><h2>Directions:</h2></p>

<p><ol>

<li>In a large bowl, toss together the beef, flour, salt, and pepper.</li>
<li>Heat the canola oil and butter in a large, roomy pan and brown the beef in it on all sides in batches. If you add all the beef at once it will lower the temperature too much and the meat will boil rather than sear. Carefully watch the beef to make sure it doesn’t burn though, but give it enough time to develop a nice, rich brown color–the <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/burnt-sugar-2137985">caramelized sugars</a> will greatly enhance the stew’s flavor.</li>
<li>Place all the beef back in the pan once browned and add the onions, garlic, brown sugar, parsley, bay leaf, and thyme and stir thoroughly. The onions will pick up a bit of the browned bits in the bottom of the pan.</li>
<li>Raise the heat under the pan and stir in the beer and add enough beef stock to cover the beef in the pan. Bring to a boil, then cover the pan, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until the beef is tender. Keep checking to make sure the beef is simmering and not boiling dry. If it seems a little dry, add a touch more stock. The liquid in the pan also should be thickening slightly. </li>
<li>Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the apple cider vinegar. Let the stew stand for 10 minutes before serving. Portion into heated bowls with the potatoes and salad on the side. </li>
